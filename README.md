This 3D Manipulator is primarily constructed from components printed on a Creality K1 Max printer. The manipulator is powered by NEMA 23 and NEMA 17 stepper motors, both of which are controlled in a closed-loop system using AS5600 encoders. Additionally, planetary gearboxes have been employed to enhance the performance and precision of the manipulator.a
